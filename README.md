### Hi there, I'm Nathan! ðŸ‘‹ <div align='right'>![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=creeds1996&color=blue)</div>

I'm a full-stack developer currently working at InfoTrack. I have a deep passion for technology and programming.

My journey began in game development, but I soon discovered my true calling in web development.

While I have experience in frontend development, my expertise and enthusiasm lie in building robust and scalable backend systems.

Beyond web development, I'm also passionate about emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence, and I enjoy exploring how AI can enhance modern applications.

## Hi there, I'm Nathan! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer currently working at InfoTrack. I have a deep passion for technology and programming.

My journey began in game development, but I soon discovered my true calling in web development.

While I have experience in frontend development, my expertise and enthusiasm lie in building robust and scalable backend systems.

Beyond web development, I'm also passionate about emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence, and I enjoy exploring how AI can enhance modern applications.
